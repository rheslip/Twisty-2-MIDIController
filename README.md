# Twisty 2 MIDIController
2nd Generation of my Twisty MIDI controller using Raspberry Pi Pico or Pico 2.

16 parameter encoders with switches and RGB LEDs, 2 menu encoders, OLED display, USB MIDI, TRS MIDI Out, Bluetooth MIDI with Pico W.
Four pages of parameters, encoder ranges, switch function and colors fully customizable. Save and recall up to 16 controller setups. STL files for 3D printed case.

Hardest part of the build is soldering the three TSSOP 74HC4067 analog MUXes. If encoders aren't working, check your soldering carefully! Rest of the build is straightforward.

Pico can be mounted with header strips. I used headers in the corners and short wires to connect the PCB to the prototype which makes the Pico board a lot easier to remove if needed.
